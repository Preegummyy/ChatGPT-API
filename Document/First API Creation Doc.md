Flask is a lightweight web application framework for Python. To create your first Flask application, you'll need to follow several steps:

1. **Setup your development environment:** First, you need to have Python installed. You can download Python from the official website. Flask works with Python 3.5 and later versions.

2. **Create a new directory:** Create a new directory for your Flask project and navigate to it using your terminal or command prompt.

3. **Create a virtual environment:** It's a good practice to create a virtual environment for your Python projects, including Flask applications. This way you can manage your project's dependencies more effectively. Use the following commands to create a new virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```
Then, to activate the virtual environment, you'll use:

- On Windows:

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

- On Unix or MacOS:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

4. **Install Flask:** After activating your virtual environment, you can install Flask using pip:

```bash
pip install flask
```

5. **Create your Flask application:** Now you can start creating your Flask application. In your project directory, create a new Python file (for example, `app.py`), and add the following code:

```python
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

This is a simple Flask application that defines a single route ("/") which returns the string "Hello, World!" when accessed.

6. **Run your Flask application:** To run your application, use the `flask run` command. But before that, you need to set the `FLASK_APP` environment variable to point to your application. Here is how you can do it:

- On Windows:

```bash
set FLASK_APP=app.py
flask run
```

- On Unix or MacOS:

```bash
export FLASK_APP=app.py
flask run
```

Now you can open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`. You should see "Hello, World!" displayed.

Remember, this is just a simple example to get you started. Flask is a powerful framework that supports a wide range of features including URL routing, template rendering, form handling, and much more.
