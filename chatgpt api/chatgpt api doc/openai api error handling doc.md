## Common Errors

### Invalid API Key Error

This error occurs when you provide an invalid API key.

```python
import openai

try:
    openai.api_key = 'your_api_key'
    print(openai.Completion.create(engine="davinci-codex", prompt="Translate this English text to French: '{}'", max_tokens=60))
except openai.Error as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

### Invalid Arguments

When the arguments provided to the API call are not valid, you'll receive an error. It may be due to incorrect formatting, missing required fields, or exceeding the limitations.

```python
try:
    response = openai.Completion.create(engine="davinci-codex", prompt="Translate this English text to French: '{}'", max_tokens=70000)
except openai.Error as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

### Rate Limit Exceeded

If you exceed your quota of requests per minute, the API will return an error.

```python
try:
    for i in range(10000):
        response = openai.Completion.create(engine="davinci-codex", prompt="Hello, world!", max_tokens=5)
except openai.Error as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```

## Best Practices

### Use Try/Except Blocks

Python's `try/except` blocks are your best tool for handling exceptions, including those thrown by the OpenAI API.

### Log Errors

Always log your errors for future analysis. This can help you understand when and why things went wrong.

### Handle Specific Errors

Python allows you to catch specific exceptions. If you're expecting a certain type of error, you can catch it specifically and handle it appropriately.

### Pyton implementation

```python
import openai
import time
import logging

# Set up logging
logging.basicConfig(filename='openai_api_errors.log', level=logging.ERROR)

# Your API key
openai.api_key = 'your_api_key'

def create_prompt():
    while True:
        try:
            response = openai.Completion.create(engine="davinci-codex", prompt="Translate this English text to French: '{}'", max_tokens=60)
            # If successful, break the loop and return the response
            return response
        except openai.AuthenticationError:
            logging.error('AuthenticationError: Invalid API key.')
            print("There was a problem with your authentication. Please check your API key.")
            break
        except openai.InvalidRequestError:
            logging.error('InvalidRequestError: Invalid API request.')
            print("You made an invalid request. Please check the provided parameters.")
            break
        except openai.RateLimitError:
            logging.error('RateLimitError: API request limit exceeded.')
            print("You've exceeded your rate limit. Waiting for 60 seconds before retrying...")
            time.sleep(60)  # wait for 60 seconds before next API call
        except Exception as e:
            logging.error(f'Unexpected error: {str(e)}')
            print("An unexpected error occurred. Please check the application logs.")
            break

# Call the function
create_prompt()
```

`create_prompt()` will keep trying to execute the API call until it's successful. If it encounters a `RateLimitError`, it will wait 60 seconds before retrying. 

For other errors (`AuthenticationError`, `InvalidRequestError`, and unexpected exceptions), the function will log the error, print an error message, and then break the loop to stop further attempts. 

Please remember that endlessly retrying after a `RateLimitError` may not be the best practice in a production environment as it may lead to API abuse. It's advisable to have a maximum retry limit and possibly an exponential backoff between retries.
